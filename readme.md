# Leverage Launcher
The objective of Leverage Launcher is to create an easy and simple way to run non-premium Minecraft.

### Project Details
- This project utilizes ExpressJS for the API and Electron to create the launcher window.
- It allows the execution of "legacy" versions of Minecraft.
- You can specify the location of library downloads and Minecraft versions.
- It provides functionality to list and check files in folders such as "mods" or "resource-packs".
- Includes a version and user account manager.

### Installation
```shell
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start in development mode
npm run start

# Build the project

```

### Interface Design Repository
The launcher's interface design is located in this repository: https://github.com/AngeloHH/leverage-launcher-frontend. Once you've built it, save the resulting files in the "public" folder of the project.
